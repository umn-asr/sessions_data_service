## Development

* [Setup](#setup)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Server](#server)
* [Deployment](#deployment)

### Setup

To get started with this app, run `./script/setup` to get dependencies installed and setup.

### Testing

This app uses RSpec for testing. There's a series of requests specs under `./spec/requests/`.

To run the test suite, run `./script/test`.

To run an individual test, `script/test path/to/single_spec.rb`.

### Server

- `script/server` starts a web server for local development, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Deployment

We have two deployment targets:

1. production: https://sessions.umn.edu
1. staging: https://sessions-staging.umn.edu

We have a deploy script that runs Capistrano under the covers to deploy the app: 

- `script/deploy`
  - Deploys to staging.
  - Requires you to enter your SSH passphrase
- `script/deploy production`
  - Deploys to production
  - Requires you to enter your SSH passphrase
